# Face-Recognition-KNN
Real Time Face Recognition using KNN and HaarCascade Classifier

This is the basic real time face recognition project using **K-Nearest Neighbours** algorithm. It uses opencv to use images draw frames. **Haarcascade Classifier** to detect faces. It was fun,but still limited to its funtion.

_TRAINING DATA: Generated by face_data_collection.py
TESTING: Real Time by face_recognition.py_
